# Coln + automerge-repo web demo

This demo stores a compiler-generated Coln realm in `automerge-repo` using a
custom document type. Custom document types aren't actually a thing in 
`automerge-repo` (yet), so we use a vendored version of `automerge-repo` from
the `doctypes` branch which adds support for custom document types.

We define a function which optionally takes compiled FFI bindings from the
compiler and turns them into an automerge-repo document type. Without bindings,
`colnDocType()` can find and sync any Coln store through raw runtime primitives.

Then, we can create and find handles containing these documents, modify and
render them, and synchronize them using the public subduction sycn server.
That's what most of the code here does.

## Compiling the schema

The demo source schema is:

- `graph.coln`

The generated FFI/IR artifacts live in:

- `src/generated/Graph.ts`
- `src/generated/GraphRealm.ts`
- `src/generated/GraphRealm.json`

`GraphRealm.ts` exports the generated `View`, `Transaction`, and `schema`. The
generic `src/colnDocType.ts` consumes that compiled FFI directly:

```ts
const coln = colnDocType(GraphRealm)
```

An existing store can also be loaded without knowing its schema:

```ts
const handle = await repo.find(url, colnDocType())
```

`GraphRealm.json` is passed directly to `StoreHandle.fromTheory(...)`; no local
IR-to-FlatTheory translation is needed anymore.

You can compile them by running `./compile.sh`

## Run

From `coln/examples/sync-demo/`:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open the Vite URL, then open the hash URL shown in the page in another tab. Each
tab creates its own Repo and syncs via Subduction.

## Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

The build script runs:

1. `./compile.sh` to regenerate `src/generated/*` from `graph.coln`
2. `tsc --noEmit`
3. `vite build`

## Test

```bash
pnpm exec playwright install chromium # first time only
pnpm test:e2e
```
